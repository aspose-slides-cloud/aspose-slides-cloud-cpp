api->getSlidesApiInfo().get()->getName();
std::shared_ptr<PostSlidesConvertRequest> request = std::make_shared<PostSlidesConvertRequest>();
request->setFormat(utility::conversions::to_string_t("pdf"));
request->setDocument(std::make_shared<std::ifstream>("MyPresentation.pptx", std::ios::binary));
std::ofstream fs("MyPresentation.pdf", std::ios::binary);
